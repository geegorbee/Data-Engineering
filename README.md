## 📊 Projects

### ETL Pipeline Demonstration
**Status:** Complete | **Date:** January 2026  
**[View Project →](./ETL-Pipeline-Demo/)**

Python-based ETL pipeline demonstrating Extract-Transform-Load workflow for batch data processing. Implements data quality validation, transformation logic, and aggregation using Pandas—simulating AWS Glue job architecture.

**What It Does:**
- Extracts transaction data from CSV source
- Validates data quality (null checks, status filtering, type conversion)
- Transforms data (aggregations, business logic, analytics)
- Loads processed data to output files

**Technologies:** Python, Pandas, ETL Design Patterns  
**Skills:** Pipeline orchestration, data quality checks, aggregation logic

## 🎯 Career Context

I'm building data engineering skills to complement my 5 years of operations experience at Canada Revenue Agency, where I managed data verification workflows and identity-dependent datasets for teams of 12-30 agents.

**Target Roles:**
- Junior Data Engineer
- Data Analyst
- GRC Automation Engineer (security + data)
- Business Intelligence Analyst

**Why Data Engineering:**  
My background in data quality validation, compliance workflows, and operational analytics translates naturally to data engineering. I'm particularly interested in roles at the intersection of data and security—where data pipelines support compliance reporting, audit evidence collection, and risk analysis.
